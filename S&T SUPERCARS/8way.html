<legend> <h2> 8 Ways Used Car Dealers Can Swindle You </h2> </legend> 

<div class=transbox>

<p>

<i> <big> As the busiest car buying weeks approach, beware the tricks of used-car salespeople.</big> </i> <br> <br>

Cars are more reliable than ever before, so buying a used car makes a lot of sense. Cars up to five or six years of 
age are often the best values. Not only are their prices far less than a comparable new car (values depreciate the 
quickest in the first four years), ownership expenses such as taxes and insurance are often much lower. Many used cars
 will also remain dependable for many years to come, making them a shrewd financial decision.

<br> <br>

If you are thinking about buying a used car, we recommend referring to J.D. Power & Associates' list of vehicles 
rated highly for dependability. You should also refer to Edmunds.com’s Consumer Ratings and Reviews to read about 
other owners' personal experiences with their vehicles.

<br> <br>

Even with all this good news, there are still many perils when buying a used car, and if you don’t know how to spot 
them, you can end up paying thousands of dollars more than you should or even losing the car. Here are eight tricks
 used-car dealers use to rip you off.

<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


<big> 1. Heavy pressure. </big>  Salespeople's favorite customers are those who seem to be in a big hurry, since they 
tend to be the ones who do not inspect the car thoroughly or don't negotiate the price. Never go to a dealership acting 
rushed, even if you need a car immediately, as they'll surely take advantage of it. In fact, while they always say they
don't want to pressure or rush you, used car salespeople typically do because it works to their advantage.
Rushing the customer often allows them to control the conversation, sometimes changing the direction to matters other
than car buying. Salespeople rush the sale to gloss over or skip important questions you may have about the car, its 
price, or the buying process. If you start to find you're confused, frustrated with the sales process, or think the 
sale is moving along faster than you want, tell the dealer you want to go home and think it over. A typical response 
from salespeople is that others are interested in the same car. Don't believe them; used car sales might be brisk, but 
not that brisk. Besides, if the car you're interested in is gone, there are plenty of other cars out there.


<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


<big> 2. Pushing certified pre-owned cars. </big>  Used-car dealers say certified pre-owned cars are the next best 
thing to buying new and they've been very popular with budget-conscious drivers who want new-car dependability without 
paying the new-car price.A certified pre-owned car typically costs $2,000 to $2,500 more than an identical non-certified 
car, but the extra price you pay is often more than what you would likely spend on repairs during the car's 
warranty period. So, these cars are
really nothing more than used cars with an expensive extended warranty tacked onto the price.One sales pitch dealers 
use to sell certified pre-owned cars is that they've passed a rigorous inspection, often citing many inspected items 
(100 or 150 are often used, perhaps because they have three digits). And while many of these inspection points may
 involve the frame, engine and other major components, quite a few of the items on the checklists are redundant, 
and some, like the windshield-washer fluid level, are actually absurd.
But some certified pre-owned cars aren't looked over closely at all. <br> <br> 

One certified pre-owned car as was famously 
covered by many news outlets back in 2007 was not one car, but two. The front half of a 2004 Chevrolet Monte Carlo
 and the back end of another Monte Carlo had been welded together. And it appeared that both halves of the FrankenCarlo 
had been involved in serious crashes.<br> <br> 

Consumers should keep in mind that there is no industry standard to define what "certified" actually means. Any used-car 
lot can claim a car is certified. It's a system that depends solely on the honesty of the seller.  
Used-car retailers say they'll fix problems they find before they sell a certified used car, but I've witnessed used cars 
arrive on a car carrier only to be immediately rolled out on the lot and tagged as "inspected and certified."
 Once when I called the management of the lot on this, they said they had every intention to inspect the vehicle before 
it was 
sold. Other used-car dealers I spoke to told us they will sell any car as certified or not certified, depending on what
 the customer is willing to spend.<br> <br> 

The only guarantee with a certified used car is that the dealership will make more money. With relatively newer used cars
 in particular, certification doesn't make much sense as most cars are relatively trouble-free in their first three to
 six years. Your best bet when buying a used car is to take it to an independent mechanic for an inspection and skip 
the in-house certification and expensive warranty and put that money into a rainy-day fund for the car if something
 goes wrong.


<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


<big> 3. Mixing negotiations. </big>  Most used car shoppers are fixated on the amount they can afford each 
month in car payments, and salespeople know this. It's their hope that you will tip your hand what you think an 
affordable monthly payment will be. Oftentimes, they'll even ask you what that figure is. Don't fall into that trap,
as a slick salesperson will use that number to pad in as much profit as he can for himself.
Used car salespeople like to start with the monthly payment because it allows them to combine the trade-in value of 
your old vehicle (should you have one), the price of the car you're purchasing, and financing terms to fit that figure. <br> <br> 

In other words, they'll get you to that monthly payment, but they'll do whatever they can to hide how they got you there.
 Mixing these negotiations allows them to show the buyer one favorable figure, like the purchase price, while obscuring a
 less favorable figure, like the trade-in price or financing terms. You will typically end up getting to your monthly 
payment when the dealership plays with the term of the loan. So if they give you a bad deal on your trade-in, they'll 
just extend the loan term by a year, and like magic, you're at your target payment.<br> <br> 

You can avoid this by negotiating every aspect of the sale separately. Start by knowing the trade-in value of your 
car, should you have one. Take into account the car's condition, mileage, age, equipment levels, which all affect its 
value. Check with sites such as Yahoo Autos and AutoTrader.com to find out what similar cars in your area are selling 
for. Your trade-in price shouldn't be much below the price than similar cars fetched in private sales.
Dealerships sometimes have two used-car pricing guides or "books" to determine the value of cars, and the prices in 
those guides can vary widely. Sometimes the dealer will use one guide to determine the value of the car they're selling
 you and another to determine the value of the trade-in. Avoid the high-ball/low-ball game by asking the dealer to use 
just one guide and look over it with you. <br> <br> 

Negotiate the price of a car that you want to purchase without revealing what you want in a trade-in. Some automotive
buying experts even recommend you not show up in the car you intend to trade in.
Only after you've negotiated this price should you discuss your trade-in. If the dealership won't come close to 
matching the price you can get in a private sale or from another used-car dealer, take the trade-in off the table and 
sell your old car elsewhere. But if you've agreed with the dealership on a trade-in price for your old car with the 
intention of applying it to your down payment, only then should you discuss financing.<br> <br> 

Now knowing the amount you need to finance for the car you intend to purchase, have your loan pre-approved by a banking 
institution, instead of the dealership. Only if the dealership comes back with financing terms that beat those of your
 bank which often happens in the 11th hour should you go with their loan.



<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


<big> 4. Obscuring a car's history. </big>  </big> While many new car dealerships that sell used cars offer services 
such as CarFax or Experian upfront, some independent used car lots are hoping you won't ask for a vehicle-history report.
 Often, they'll try to assure you they know plenty about the history and tell you not to worry. If they continue to try to
 stall or change the subject, this should send up a red flag, as they may be hiding something such as odometer fraud; 
flood, fire or accident damage; or evidence the car was once a salvage vehicle. While a clean car-history report doesn't
 guarantee that the car you're interested in won't have any of these problems, it does a good job of sniffing them out.



<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


<big> 5. Balking at an independent evaluation.</big>  After you make an offer on a used car, but before you sign anything,
 you should take the vehicle to a qualified mechanic who routinely does automotive diagnostic work. Many dealers will balk
 at this, saying they won't let an outside party mess with the car. They'll also tell you they've already inspected the
 car for you. However, nothing beats the certainty of an inspection by a third party. Many times, they'll find issues 
with the car that will need attention soon, like costly suspension, brakes, exhaust, and engine problems. If an
 independent mechanic finds any problems with the car, deduct the cost of any needed repairs from the price or ask
 that the dealer have the problems fixed before you purchase the car.


<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 

<big> 6. Finance markup.</big>  Even major lenders like banks and credit unions typically charge more for a
 used-car loan than for a new-car loan; however, some dealerships that sell used cars have taken it to extremes. 
While the margin they make on used cars is often the biggest profit center for dealerships that also sell new cars,
 in-house financing is another cash cow. What typically happens when you apply for financing through a dealership 
is that they take your loan application to several lenders to see what interest rates you qualify for. <br><br>

So, if the best interest rate they can find for you is 7%, they'll come back to you with a rate that's between 2-4 points higher,
skimming that extra interest right off the top and sometimes splitting it with the finance company.
The sad part is you might not even see much of a difference in your monthly payment, but the money adds up. <br><br>

Let's say you were to finance $15,000 for a car and you qualified for 7% interest on a 48-month loan. If you were
to get that rate, your payments would be $359.19 a month. But if the dealership comes back with their pre-packaged 
loan and the rate they'll give you is 9.5%, you will be paying $376.85 a month. While $17.86 a month might not seem 
a lot more, you will be paying $847.68 over the life of the loan.


<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


<big> 7. The spot delivery scam.</big>  Don't ever take a car home unless all the financing has been
 completed. Some unscrupulous used-car lots use a "spot delivery scam," where they allow potential buyers 
to leave with the car they've chosen before financing has been completed, only to call them up several days 
later to tell them the loan has fallen through. Then they ask for the car to be returned, sometimes threatening 
repossession.<br><br>

When the car buyer returns to the dealership with the car, the finance officer is typically waiting with an 
alternative loan at a higher interest rate or a larger down payment, sometimes both. And when the price is 
marked up, a dealership can make thousands of dollars in unearned fraudulent gain.<br><br>

This scam is most commonly used against buyers with bad credit scores, since dealerships perceive such people
 as vulnerable and easier to take advantage of. The best way to prevent a spot delivery scam is not to take delivery 
of a vehicle until you have been fully approved for a loan by the dealer or a separate financial institution. Again, 
it might be to your advantage to come to the dealership with your financing already arranged.<br><br>


<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


<big> 8. Remotely disabling the car you've purchased.</big>  Car dealers and other automotive lenders are

 targeting those with poor credit by installing GPS-based kill switches, or starter-interrupt devices, on 
the cars that they sell. The New York Times recently reported that about 2 million cars are now outfitted 
with such kill switches in the U.S., which is about one-quarter of subprime car loans. The remote disabling 
of cars can also hasten the eventual repossession and resale of the car. Used-car dealers and other smarmy 
creditors are not shy when it comes to remotely disabling cars whose owners are behind on their payments,
 but some consumers have reported that their cars were shut down even when they were current on payments. <br><br> 

Most of these devices are installed at the point of sale by "Buy Here, Pay Here" dealers that make direct 
car loans to customers. Not only does this give the dealer the capability to disable the vehicle, it allows
 the dealer to track the movements of customers, which is a major concern for privacy advocates.<br><br>

Used-car dealers are quick to justify the starter-interrupt systems, saying that without them, hundreds of 
thousands of automotive loans would not be possible and they allow many more people the freedom of car 
ownership than would otherwise be possible. The National Alliance Survey says starter-interrupt systems
 disable 14% of cars immediately when the payment day is missed, while 30% of consumers are provided with 
a short grace period. About 54% of lenders use discretion with the systems, while another 1% report only 
using them as a threat.<br><br>

But borrowers tell a different story. Many have told various media outlets that their cars have been shut
 off without warning, leaving them in a lurch or in danger. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that cars 
have been disabled even when owners are current with payments.<br><br>

Many lenders, such as credit unions and some regional and national banks, do not require starter-interrupt
 systems to get a loan. Always check to see if you can secure financing through one of those institutions
 before you allow one of these kill switches to be put on a car you purchase. <br><br>
